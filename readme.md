# D365 PCF - Image Control

## Image control for Multiple Lines of Text fields
This control can be added as a custom control for a Multiple Lines of Text field to display the contents as an image

![Drag and Drop Here](./docs/res/DragAndDropHere.png)
![Sample Image](./docs/res/Sample.png)

The control will store the Base64 encoded content of the PNG image without the `data:image/png;base64,` at the start

This will allow us to output the image in a word document, as shown in the example below
![Word Template Example](./docs/res/WordTemplateExample.png)
